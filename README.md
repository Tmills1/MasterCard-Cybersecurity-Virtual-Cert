Welcome to Mastercard’s Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program! We are so excited to have you here!

As the world of electronic payments grows, so do we. And we want you to grow with us. Mastercard is part of the NY CEO Jobs Council - a consortium of 30 large NYC employers who are committed to employing 100,000 youth from underserved communities over the next decade. The CEOs of these companies have made a personal pledge to the initiative.

In this virtual experience, you will have the opportunity to build skills and learn what it’s like to work as a Security Analyst at Mastercard. Specifically, you’ll help design a phishing email simulation for the Security Awareness team. You will learn that cyber threats come in many different forms and that you don’t need a technical background to help keep a company and its employees safe from threats.

We hope this program provides a great resource for you to up-skill and strengthen your resume as you explore career options and a potential career in cybersecurity!
